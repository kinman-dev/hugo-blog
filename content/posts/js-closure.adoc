== Definition
Closure is the concept of function + lexical scope.
The state(both variable and lexical scope) inside a function will be preserved when it is declared,
and being keep alive to observe or make updates to these variables over time.

[source,js]
----
const score = () => {
  let point = 100;//variable in outer scope are considered "private".
  return () => {
    return point++;//scope chain is maintained, 
  };
};
//"point" is like a private variable belong to its instance
//tommy has his own state of "point".
//sally has her own state of "point".
const tommy = score(); //point = 100, closure is created and saved to the heap. 
const sally = score(); //point = 100, closure is created and saved to the heap. 
console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 100
console.log("sally:" + sally());//sally's point = 100
console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 101
console.log("tommy:" + tommy());//tommy's point = 102
console.log("sally:" + sally());//sally's point = 101

== P.S.
Closure let you associate data (the lexical environment) with a function that operates on that data, 
and enable data privacy, I'd like to think of it similar to the concept of encapsulation from OOP.
Side note, closure consumes more memory, because the state is saved in the heap.

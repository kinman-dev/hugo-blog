== Background

When I heard that Java is always passed by value, I took the C/C++ way of thinking that changing the value inside a function would not take effective.
Actually, it is not as simple as that.
For Java, if it is a reference type object(not primitive data type), it would pass the copy of the address that the object refers to,
and if this object is mutable, changing the value inside a function can take effective. 
[source,java]
----
public static void main(String[] args) {
    String immutableStingExample = "abc";
    StringBuilder mutableStingExample = new StringBuilder("abc");
    System.out.println("Before function is called: ");
    System.out.println("immutableStingExample: "+ immutableStingExample);
    System.out.println("mutableStingExample: "+ mutableStingExample);
    doSomething(immutableStingExample, mutableStingExample);
    System.out.println("After function is called: ");
    System.out.println("immutableStingExample: "+ immutableStingExample);
    System.out.println("mutableStingExample: "+ mutableStingExample);
}
static void doSomething(String immutableStingExample, StringBuilder mutableStingExample){
    immutableStingExample = "xyz";
    mutableStingExample = mutableStingExample.
        replace(0, mutableStingExample.length(), "xyz");
}
----

Output:
----
Before function is called: 
immutableStingExample: abc
mutableStingExample: abc
After function is called: 
immutableStingExample: abc
mutableStingExample: xyz

== P.S.
I think that is one of the reasons why understanding the concept of immutability in Java is so important.

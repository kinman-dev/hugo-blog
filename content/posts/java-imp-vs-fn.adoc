== Background

Let's say we have a list of teams, and we want to find out if my team is the list.
[source,java]
----
public static void main(final String[] argv){
    final List<String> teams = 
        List.of("Arsenal","Brighton ","Chelsea", "Liverpool", "West Ham");
    final String targetTeam = "Man Utd";
    findTeamImperative(teams, targetTeam);
    findTeamFunctional(teams, targetTeam);
}
----

== Imperative
Use the for-each loop to go through the list.

[source,java]
----
private static void findTeamImperative(final List<String> teams, final String targetTeam) {
    boolean found = false;
    for(String team : teams){
        if(team.equals(targetTeam)){
            found = true;
            break;
        }
    }
    System.out.printf("found %s? %s\n",targetTeam, found);
}
----

== Functional
Use functional stream API go through the list
[source,java]
----
private static void findTeamFunctional(final List<String> teams, final String targetTeam) {
     final int found = (int) teams.stream().filter(t -> t.equals(targetTeam)).count();
     System.out.printf("found %s? %s\n",targetTeam, found > 0 ? true : false);
 }
----

== P.S.
Functional programming does not need to mutate\change the variable when going through the list, it promotes immutability and causes less side effects.

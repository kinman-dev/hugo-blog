== About
Refer to https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc[The One Billion Row Challenge],
although the purpose of the One Billion Row Challenge is to see how fast pure Java can achieve,
in day to day work, we usually deal with this kind of data transformation using SQL with a database.
Let me take it as an execise for using SQL window function. 


[source,sql]
----
-- using window function to get the min for one city
SELECT
	STATION_NAME,
	MEASUREMENT,
	ROUND(
		MIN(MEASUREMENT::NUMERIC) OVER (
			PARTITION BY
				STATION_NAME
		),
		1
	) AS MIN_MEASUREMENT
FROM
	WEATHER_STATIONS
WHERE
	STATION_NAME = 'Santa Cruz';
----


[source,sql]
----
-- using window function to get the min, mean, max over paititon by the same city
SELECT DISTINCT
	STATION_NAME,
	MIN_MEASUREMENT,
	MEAN_MEASUREMENT,
	MAX_MEASUREMENT
FROM
	(
		SELECT
			STATION_NAME,
			ROUND(
				MIN(MEASUREMENT::NUMERIC) OVER (
					PARTITION BY
						STATION_NAME
				),
				1
			) AS MIN_MEASUREMENT,
			ROUND(
				AVG(MEASUREMENT::NUMERIC) OVER (
					PARTITION BY
						STATION_NAME
				),
				1
			) AS MEAN_MEASUREMENT,
			ROUND(
				MAX(MEASUREMENT::NUMERIC) OVER (
					PARTITION BY
						STATION_NAME
				),
				1
			) AS MAX_MEASUREMENT
		FROM
			WEATHER_STATIONS
	) AS SUBQUERY
ORDER BY
	1 ASC;

== P.S.
Before sql having window function, we had to select a lot of subqueries and then join them.
Now we can do thing with much more simpler statement. I also implemented a springboot demo 
https://github.com/kinman-dev/1brc-using-sql[project]
using JOOQ to do simluate the window function.
